# Sean Ly — Coding Portfolio

A collection of software projects that reflect my background in aerospace Reliability & Maintainability engineering and my transition into backend development and site reliability. These projects emphasize rigor, systems thinking, and maintainable design.

## Projects

### 1. Reliability Service
A production-style backend service implementing basic Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability calculations. Demonstrates API design, Pydantic v2 modeling, layered validation, structured logging, and a pytest suite.

### 2. Markov Decision Service
A production-style backend service which implements methods for solving Markov Decision Process related questions. current implemntation only allows for Relative value iteration to find a policy that finds the optimal average reward of a stationary policy.
